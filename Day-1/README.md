# Weather Data to AWS S3 Bucket

The application is designed to fetch real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API and store it securely in an AWS S3 bucket for further analysis or archival purposes. By leveraging the OpenWeather API, the application ensures access to accurate and up-to-date weather information. The application is developed using a virtual environment (venv) to manage dependencies, ensuring a clean and consistent development environment. This setup makes it ideal for use cases such as weather monitoring systems, data analytics pipelines, or applications requiring real-time weather insights.
